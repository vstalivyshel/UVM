### Ukrainian Virtual Machine
### Very much WIP

Source of inspiration: https://github.com/tsoding/bm

Goals:
- Learn things.
- Build a simple virtual machine.
- Build an assembly for this VM.
- Try to create a programming language using the assembly of my VM.

And all that great stuff will be interfaced using Ukrainian (yeah, boy).  

Progress:

-  [x] Basic stack implementation:
```
Basic instructions: Push, Drop, Dup, DupAt
Binary instructions: Sub, Sum, Mul, Div, Eq
Flow instructions: Jump, JumpIf
```
- [ ] TODO
