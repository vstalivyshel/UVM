### Ukrainian Virtual Machine
### WIP

Simple VM representation POWERED BY UKRAINIAN LANGUAGE AND UKRAINIAN SPIRIT and other stuff, you know.

I really want to call this thing UASM, but there is already one.  

Source of inspiration: https://github.com/tsoding/bm

The goal is to create a basic computer simulation and provide an interface to interact with it using ukrainian language  (yea) in the style of an assembly family.

Progress:
- [X] Stack
- [x] Basic instructions for the top values of the stack: Push, Sum, Substruct, Divide, Multiply
